# Pinger
A tiny python script to run in the background while connected to unreliable internet

The script attemts to get webpage (by default google.com) and if the get reponce is 200 the log is printed and the sound chime is audible (supported for Windows only for now). This get attempt is happening once in ~30 seconds.
